This is pre-alpha software and bugs and security holes will certainly be found.

Pull requests are VERY welcome.  If you are looking for a project to help out with,
this project has many things that could use your help from:

-changing the command line tool to use nice switch statements instead of messy if/else's

-making the code pretty and functionally better

-write code to catch and handle errors (there are so, so many that need it)

-adding features

-writing middleware

-writing documentation
