Spokes is a dart web framework inspired by Django for python.

poorly formatted wiki at: https://github.com/billysometimes/spokes/wiki

This is pre-alpha software and bugs and security holes will certainly be found.

Pull requests are VERY welcome.  If you are looking for a project to help out with,
this project has many things that could use your help from:

-changing the command line tool to use nice switch statements instead of messy if/else's

-making the code pretty and functionally better

-write code to catch and handle errors (there are so, so many that need it)

-adding features

-writing middleware

-writing documentation 

-testing windows support




Project Goals:

- spokes should never require anything other than the dart runtime.
  Grunt.js and SASS are cool, and optional middlewares for spokes would be
  super cool, but no external tools shall ever be *required* for spokes.
 
- spokes should be light weight.  It is easier for developers to manually
  add custom packages than it is for them to remove deeply integrated fluff.
  
- Always march forward.  Backwards compatibility is not an issue, spokes will
  always strive to be compatible will the latest stable version of dart.
